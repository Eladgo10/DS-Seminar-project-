Automobile Insurance Fraud is one of the main challenges for insurance
companies, causing yearly substantial financial losses worldwide and
impairing the speed and quality of services to insured customers. In recent
years, applications of machine learning models for fraud detection have been
studied to deal with this problem. Often fraud detection problem is a private
case of an imbalanced classification problem. A classification problem that
concerns many other areas, such as credit card, health insurance, financial
statements, disease detection, etc. Traditional classification algorithms can be
limited in their performance on highly unbalanced datasets. In this study, we
focus on comparing 3 machine learning models - Random Forest, Support
Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes; and the combination of those models with
imbalance classification techniques - Synthetic Minority Oversampling
Technique, Near Miss Undersampling, cost sensitivity learning and feature
selection decomposition. We evaluate models’ performance by a few relevant
metrics – Area Under ROC curve (AUC-ROC), F-scoring, G-mean and Area
Under Precision/Recall Curve (AUC-PR). Of the 15 methods and models
combinations considered in this paper, Random Forest with Cost Sensitivity
technique achieved the best performance metrics. We have shown that the test
results of the chosen model can be used as a preliminary filter of identifying a
claim fraud for insurance companies and a high confidence that a classified
non-fraudulent claim is indeed so.
